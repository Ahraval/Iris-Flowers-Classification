# Iris-Flowers-Classification

This project is a classification problem on the iris flower dataset. In this project, I used 10-fold cross-validation to train scikit-learn models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
